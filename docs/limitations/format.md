# String formatting

Monty implements CPython 3.14's format mini-language for f-string
interpolations and `str.format()` replacement fields. `str.format()` supports
positional and keyword fields, automatic and manual numbering, attribute and
item access, `!s` / `!r` / `!a` conversions, nested replacement fields in
format specs, and escaped braces.

Attribute access is limited to lookups that complete inside the sandbox.
If a replacement field needs a host operation, such as
`'{0.environ}'.format(os)`, Monty raises
`NotImplementedError: str.format attribute access cannot suspend` instead of
returning the attribute as CPython does.

The other CPython formatting entry points are not implemented:

- The `format()` builtin raises `NameError`, and `str.format_map()` raises
    `AttributeError` (see [builtins.md](builtins.md)).
- Printf-style `%` formatting (`'%5.3f' % math.pi`, `'%s %s' % (a, b)`) is not
    implemented. `str` has no `__mod__`, so `str % value` raises
    `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'str' and '...'`. Use an
    f-string instead.

## Custom `__format__`

f-strings and `str.format()` dispatch to a type's `__format__` only for
`date`, `datetime` and `time`, which interpret the spec as a `strftime` string
(`f'{dt:%Y-%m-%d}'` or `'{:%Y-%m-%d}'.format(dt)`); see
[datetime.md](datetime.md). There is no general `__format__` protocol: user
classes can't customise formatting (see [classes.md](classes.md)), and all
other types use the builtin mini-language formatter. A format spec on a
user-class instance is silently applied to `str(obj)` (`f'{obj:>10}'` pads),
where CPython raises `TypeError: unsupported format string passed to Foo.__format__`.

## The `n` type uses the C locale only

`n` always behaves as in the C/POSIX locale (Monty has no locale support):
like `d` for integers and `g` for floats, with no digit grouping. CPython
under a grouping locale would insert locale-specific separators; Monty never
does.

## `repr` of non-printable Unicode

`repr` escapes non-printable code points via the `unicode-general-category`
crate, whose Unicode version may lag CPython's, so a code point assigned in a
newer Unicode release than the crate ships could be escaped by Monty while
CPython prints it literally, or the reverse. Common text is unaffected.

## Width / precision bounds

- A `width` or `precision` whose decimal value overflows `usize` raises
    `SyntaxError: Invalid format specifier '...': width or precision overflows usize` in a literal f-string spec.
    Runtime specs, including `str.format()`, raise `ValueError` instead, with an additional
    `for object of type '...'` suffix.
- Very large widths/precisions are additionally bounded by the resource
    tracker; see [resource_limits.md](resource_limits.md).

## When spec errors are raised

CPython validates a *static* (literal) f-string spec only when the f-string
executes, so a malformed spec in dead code never raises. Monty validates
literal f-string specs at **compile time** for the structurally-malformed cases:
two or more trailing
characters after the type field (`f'{1:kk}'`, `f'{1:10xyz}'`) and `usize`
overflow, raising `SyntaxError` instead of CPython's runtime `ValueError`. The
message text otherwise matches, minus CPython's `for object of type '...'`
suffix, which needs the runtime value type. Specs whose error *is*
value-type-dependent or only resolvable at format time (`Unknown format code 'k'`, the `Cannot specify …` grouping conflicts, and `Format specifier missing precision`) are deferred to runtime and raise the exact CPython `ValueError`,
as do all dynamically-built specs (`f'{1:{spec}}'`) and all `str.format()`
specs.
